I am a full-time faculty member in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Xinjiang University. I earned my PhD in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021. Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems at Xinjiang University in 2009, and my Bachelor's degree in Resource Environment and Urban-Rural Planning Management at Xinjiang University in 2006.
My research journey has been shaped by long-term engagement in geographic information science and computer science interdisciplinary research. I have accumulated rich experience in teaching and scientific research during my tenure at Xinjiang University, focusing on applying information technology to solve practical problems in regional development and urban management.
My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Video Behavior Understanding, and Urban Computing. I am committed to promoting the integration of artificial intelligence and urban governance, and welcome collaborations with researchers and practitioners in related fields. Feel free to reach out for academic discussions or potential partnerships.
